  abstract = {Machine to Machine (M2M) communication is the backbone of large-scale
	urban sensing, one of the enabling technologies of the Smart City.
	Some smart grids are already using M2M for efficient energy management
	and residential smart meters. The 4th Generation (4G) wireless networks
	are expected to be used for the majority of the M2M traffic. M2M
	communication over 4G networks faces some deployment challenges.
	One of the challenges is the difficulty of managing the subscription
	of M2M terminals. The challenge is how can an M2M operator, like
	a utility company, activate or change the subscription of an M2M
	terminal, like a smart meter, remotely, without requiring a person
	be at the equipment location. The current subscription management
	scheme that has been used for human subscribers is based on using
	the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) application to store
	subscriber information in a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC).
	An operator change requires a new UICC from the new operator. This
	scheme is not suitable for M2M terminals due to the large number
	of terminals and the nature of their deployment in remote areas.
	The UICC in the M2M terminals are, in some cases, permanently sealed
	to prevent tampering and are thus not removable. This paper discusses
	the challenges of subscription management of M2M terminals communicating
	over the 4G networks. We present a solution to remotely manage the
	M2M subscription. The solution which is based on the Evolved Packet
	Core (EPC) of the 4G cellular network facilitates Over-The-Air (OTA)
	subscription activation or change for M2M terminals.},

	This requires a need for Common Radio Resource Management (CRRM)

	algorithms are an important part of CRRM. This paper proposes an
	intelligent hybrid power efficient RAT selection algorithm (patent

	available RATs, collecting information on each RAT using the IEEE
	P1900.4 Protocol, and making decisions for selecting the most suitable
	RAT for incoming calls. The proposed power efficient algorithm is
	compared to centralized and distributed algorithms in terms of new
	call blocking and Vertical Handover (VHO) call dropping probabilities.
	Users' satisfactions probability and saving battery power percentage
	are also compared. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
	performs better than the centralized and distributed algorithms in

	The proposed and the distributed algorithms have similar performance
	in term of saving battery power, and both perform better than the

  abstract = {The fast growing market for wireless Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication
	services is facing specific challenges which do not exist comparably
	in the traditional cellular subscriber market. The challenges are
	emerging around the changed ecosystem and value chain and dealing
	with different traffic and load profiles in the network. The significantly
	reduced ARPDs (average revenue per device) are calling for increased
	operational efficiency and flexibility and tangible cost reductions.
	With regard to the requirements arising in this context this paper
	focuses on new concepts for SIM management (SIM: Subscriber Identity
	Module) in the M2M domain from a subscription management perspective
	in order to develop an economic MCIM provisioning process (MCIM:
	M2M communication identity module). Three technical concepts were
	addressed and described with a look on the critical features. Essential
	items are the circle of trust, the grade of flexibility, the complexity
	of the solution and the impact on security. A further evolution of
	the Embedded UICC (Universal Integrated Circuit Card) proposal currently
	handled in standardization is presented and discussed, which gives
	the device owner and the M2M service provider a more active role
	and responsibility in the process. This approach enables full flexibility
	for change of operator and subscription and requires less administrative
	effort from MNOs (Mobile Network Operators), in particular for devices
	currently not requiring an active subscription. The respective business

	It is a big challenge to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) for
	M2M services in traditional telecomm. network. This paper focuses
	on the QoS categorization of M2M services. Based on the analysis
	of typical M2M use cases in market, a M2M service category is proposed
	according to traffic characteristics at first. Then, the existing
	QoS classes for H2H communications is analyzed, and it can be concluded
	that the QoS categorization of H2H communications is mainly based
	on delay, because voice is the main service in H2H communication.
	However, the conversational service is quite few in M2M communications,
	thus the existing QoS category cannot meet the requirement of M2M
	services. So a new QoS category with nine classes for M2M services
	is proposed according to real-time, accuracy and priority. And the
	characters of each QoS class are also analyzed. Furthermore, the
	mapping of H2H QoS category and M2M QoS category is also proposed.
	The proposed new QoS category can meet the QoS requirements of both
	M2M services and H2H services. And it is a self-contained, universal
	category method, providing a useful reference to build M2M QoS architecture.},

	(CN) capable of supporting real-time packet services over multiple

	architecture to better support Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC) and
	more flexible CN sharing solutions. This goal is achieved with a
	clearer separation of the business roles (e.g. access and network

	the number of devices accessing the network in the next few years,

	of extreme cases where MTC devices may act in a synchronized way.
	In GSM networks, the signaling capacity may be temporarily blocked,
	limiting the access of normal services for some seconds, or even
	minutes. This paper proposes one solution for overload problem caused
	by MTC device synchronization using the Orthogonal sub- channels
	technique (OSC). Statistical analysis over the effects of synchronized
	MTC devices are used to provide an overview on the achievable access
	procedure delay reduction when using this technique. The proposed

  abstract = {Owing to ubiquity of wireless technologies, user satisfaction is greatly
	affected by the factor such as terminal mobility, guaranteeing quality
	of service, continuous connectivity to access the world anywhere,
	anytime and any service has gained a significant importance. Hence,
	the future generation wireless networks have projected as the integration
	of various wireless access networks. Seamless internetworking of
	heterogeneous network is still a stimulating assignment and requires
	interconnectivity at all layers of network architecture. In mobile
	communication, seamless vertical handover is one of the most challenging
	issues. The worst case may cause communication interruption, delays
	and packet losses which affect the real time communication performance.
	To resolve the problem of prevailing schemes, a marginal fast vertical
	handover Mobile IP (MIP) protocol using IEEE 802.21 Media Independent
	Handover (MIH) standard is proposed. In this paper optimized vertical
	handover functionality is illustrated for heterogeneous WLAN/WiMAX
	networks based on IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover which combines
	network functionality from all different access technologies into
	common set of Commands, Events and Services. The proposed handover
	scenario is used to evaluate the vertical handover performance involving
	multimode terminal with WLAN/WiMAX interfaces and IEEE 802.21 entities.
	This capability proves an efficient solution for mobility, multihoming
	and routing for integrating heterogeneous networks. In addition,
	the proposed scheme can reduce considerably traffic overhead between
	WLAN/WiMAX networks, handover latency and base station scanning interval
	time. The presented handover scenario concludes by presenting service
	continuity during and after vertical handover.},

	the current cellular network is designed for human-to-human communication

	which network operators are currently facing, is MTC related signalling

	device not only shares a secret key with home environment, but also
	a group secret key with home environment and other MTC devices belong
	to the same group. Then signalling data is reduced between serving
	network and home environment, by the MTC device using this group
	key as an authentication key and authenticating locally. Furthermore,
