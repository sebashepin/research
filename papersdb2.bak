	subscribers in the era of converging radio access technologies. By
	supporting handovers to and from WiFi networks, UMA seems to be a
	perfect solution as new mobile services require performance and seamless
	mobility. From the cellular operator point of view UMA does not require
	enormous investments and is a good choice for extending network coverage.
	This research paper discusses the technical implications of UMA based
	on measurement results for GSM to WiFi handovers and packet data
	performance. The measurements show that UMA works well, and voice
	handover breaks are similar or lower than those experienced in traditional
	GSM systems. In addition, UMA provides a considerably higher throughput
	than GSM systems. The results showed that the average throughput
	is twice or more than in GSM. Therefore, the user experience for
	data services improves to 3G-kind of services.},

  abstract = {As the concept of fixed-mobile convergence (FMC) is gaining popularity
	among operators and consumers, there is an increasing debate about
	the performance of the mobile-network-centric UMA architecture versus
	the IP-centric VCC architecture. While UMA-based FMC solutions are
	already launched for commercial use, VCC-based solutions are still
	in their trial stages. The purpose of this paper is to compare the
	performance of the two architectures based on the call handover (HO)
	delay and throughput, in order to answer the following question:
	is preferring UMA over VCC a business decision or a technical performance
	decision? We found that the two architectures do not significantly
	differ from one another in throughput when subject to different traffic
	and delay profiles. Moreover, the literature shows that, similar
	to UMA, VCC is capable of handling data-session continuity between
	different network domains. Thus, the choice between UMA and VCC is
	governed by non-technical factors such as network upgrade cost for
	different operator profiles. The mobile-network centric UMA is better
	suited for mobile operators whereas the IP-centric VCC is suited
	for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) that do not own a licensed
	spectrum or a mobile core network.},

  abstract = {The evolution of wireless network standards, e.g., GSM/GPRS, UMTS,
	WiFi, WiMAX, and end-user devices has paved the way towards Next
	Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN), where users are always connected
	through multiple radio access networks. NGMN technologies target
	to improve the user experience especially for mobile data and multimedia
	services, which are in line with user expectations evident from,
	for instance, the increasingly popular mobile HTTP video streaming.
	To understand the quality that can be offered to the user in NGMNs,
	we compare the Quality of Experience (QoE) for HTTP streaming in
	a prototype NGMN testbed with WiFi and 3G UMTS/HSDPA support. We
	use CUBIC TCP as the transport layer protocol as it is typically
	the default TCP variant, e.g., in Android phones. We complement the
	QoE estimations with network QoS parameters such as throughput and
	delay, and transport layer statistics. The results of our evaluation
	show that (i) video QoE remains stable in WiFi even for high packet
	losses compared to UMTS, (ii) QoE in UMTS is sensitive to packet
	loss even for low loss rates due to high variations in the network
	QoS, namely, throughput and delay, (iii) the decrease in QoE and
	QoS in HSDPA is due to its negative interactions with the aggressive
	congestion control of CUBIC TCP, and (iv) handover from WiFi to HSDPA
	degrades QoE.},

  abstract = {One of the key elements in the emerging, packet-based long term evolution
	(LTE) cellular systems is the deployment of multiple femtocells for
	the improvement of coverage and data rate. However, arbitrary overlaps
	in the coverage of these femto-cells make the handover operation
	more complex and challenging. As the existing handover strategy of
	LTE systems considers only carrier to interference plus noise ratio
	(CINR), it often suffers from resource constraints in the target
	femtocell, thereby leading to handover failure. In this paper, we
	propose a new efficient, multi-objective handover solution for LTE
	cellular systems. The proposed solution considers multiple parameters
	like signal strength and available bandwidth in the selection of
	the optimal target cell. This results in a significant increase in
	the handover success rate, thereby reducing the blocking of handover
	and new sessions. The overall handover process is modeled and analyzed
	by a three-dimensional Markov chain. The analytical results for the
	major performance metrics closely resemble the simulation results.
	The simulation results show that the proposed multi-objective handover
	offers considerable improvement in the session blocking rates, session
	queuing delay, handover latency, and goodput during handover.},
